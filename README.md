# Christopher McKenzie

**Software & ML Engineer-in-Training • BSCS @ WGU (’26) • NYC**

I’m a mechanical engineer turned CS student building practical software and ML projects—especially around tennis analytics, optimization, and data-driven apps. I like clean architecture, reproducible experiments, and shipping things people can actually use.

- 🔭 **Now**: Tennis ML capstone predicting match winners from rally/serve features (Python, scikit-learn, Django UI)
- 🌱 **Learning**: React fundamentals + data viz patterns
- 📍 NYC • open to data/ML/software roles (NYC/hybrid/remote)
- 📫 **Email**: Chris.mcke876@gmail.com • **GitHub**: @chalrees876

## Highlights

- **Tennis Match Outcome Predictor**  
  Logistic regression on first-serve%, double faults, and derived rally stats; full pipeline with train/test split, ROC-AUC, confusion matrix, and Django views that render Matplotlib charts.  
  _Tech_: Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn, Django  
  _Repo_: [[link](https://github.com/chalrees876/tennisPrediction)]

- **WGUPS Routing (Algorithms)**  
  Optimized package delivery with custom hash tables and nearest-neighbor; complexity analysis and instrumentation.  
  _Tech_: Python, Data Structures/Algorithms  
  _Repo_: [[link]](https://github.com/chalrees876/Truck-Delivery-Optimization)

- **Spring Boot Inventory Management**  
  CRUD for parts/products with validation (inventory bounds), Thymeleaf forms, unit tests.  
  _Tech_: Java, Spring Boot, JPA/Hibernate, Thymeleaf, MySQL  
  _Repo_: [link]

## What I’m Looking For

I’m excited to contribute to **data/ML engineering** or **full-stack** teams that value readable code, reproducible experiments, and pragmatic shipping. If your team is working on analytics products, ML-powered features, or data platforms—I’d love to chat.
