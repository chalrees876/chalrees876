# Hi, I'm Chris 👋

**Mechanical Engineer → CS graduate → Aspiring Data Scientist / ML Engineer.**  
I build practical data/ML and full-stack projects—clean code, clear results, shipped.

- 🔭 **Now**: Tennis ML capstone predicting match winners from rally/serve features (Python, scikit-learn, Django UI)
- 🌱 **Learning**: React fundamentals + data viz patterns
- 📍 NYC • open to data/ML/software roles (NYC/hybrid/remote)
